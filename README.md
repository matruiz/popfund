### Who We Are
popfund aims to alleviate mom and pop shop financial struggles through Covid-19. To do this, we will create a centralized platform where individuals can stimulate local businesses in a variety of ways, such as buying their products and services, donating to these businesses, or participating in bids thus helping them pay their employees. In doing so, the local community has the opportunity to help ensure the future of their favorite local businesses after the quarantine.
